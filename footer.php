footer.php - The stinky script no one wants to touch. Just edit config.php to change values in here.
Script Created by Mitchell Urgero
Date: Sometime in 2016 ;)
Website: https://urgero.org
E-Mail: info@urgero.org

Script is distributed with Open Source Licenses, do what you want with it. ;)
"I wrote this because I saw that there are not that many databaseless Forums for PHP. It needed to be done. I think it works great, looks good, and is VERY mobile friendly. I just hope at least one other person
finds this PHP script as useful as I do."
